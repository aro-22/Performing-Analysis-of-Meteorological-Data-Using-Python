# Performing-Analysis-of-Meteorological-Data-Using-Python

# Overview

In this 10 years of Dataset, we can see as per year increases Apparent temperature and humidity are not related. For all the year monthly average humidity is the same but the Apparent temperature is different. Global warming is affecting the earth’s temperature so that we see some uncertainty in this data.

# Hypothesis for this project

The Null Hypothesis H0 is “Has the Apparent temperature and humidity compared monthly across 10 years of the data indicate an increase due to Global warming”

Apparent Temperature: Apparent temperature is the temperature equivalent perceived by humans, caused by the combined effects of air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed. The measure is most commonly applied to the perceived outdoor temperature.

Humidity: Humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air. If there is a lot of water vapor in the air, the humidity will be high.

# Dataset

The dataset has hourly temperature recorded for the last 10 years starting from 2006–04–01 00:00:00.000 +0200 to 2016–09–09 23:00:00.000 +0200. It corresponds to Finland, a country in Northern Europe.

# Conclusion
In this 10 years of Dataset, we can see as per year increases Apparent temperature and humidity are not related. For all the year monthly average humidity is the same but the Apparent temperature is different. Global warming is affecting the earth’s temperature so that we see some uncertainty in this data.
